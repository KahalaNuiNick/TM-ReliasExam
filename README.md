# TM-ReliasExam
Tampermonkey script to assist building exams when copying and pasting multiple-choice source material

This script allows you to copy a question and it's answer(s) in their entireity, then paste each line with a dedicated key combination.
For example, after copying the entire question and answers:
1. This is the question  
   A. Answer 1  
   B. Answer 2  
   C. Answer 3  
   D. Answer 4  
  
You would click in the question space and hit Alt+1 to paste the question.  
Click in the first answer space and hit Alt+a to paste Answer 1.  
Repeat until complete.  
  
When pasting double-digit questions, it'll put an extra space, but Relias trims that out as soon as you save the quesion
